# HistoryQA-NLP-Driven-Query-Answering-System
NLP
This project involves the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Information Retrieval (IR) techniques to develop an advanced query-answering system. Starting with data scraping from a world history book, we utilize a combination of TF-IDF and Sentence-BERT (sBERT) to find the most relevant documents for a given query. Following this, we employ the OpenAI API to use Generative AI to construct answers based on the selected documents. The overall goal is to create a robust system capable of providing detailed, accurate responses to questions about world history.

# How to Run
-> Begin by running the scraping.py file to fetch the data. Alternatively, you can use the pre-existing output.csv.
-> Next, navigate to generativeAi.py. Here, input your question into the query variable.                                                            
-> Finally, execute the generativeAi.py script. The system will generate and display the response to your query.
