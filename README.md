# HistoryQA-NLP-Driven-Query-Answering-System
NLP
This project involves the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Information Retrieval (IR) techniques to develop an advanced query-answering system. Starting with data scraping from a world history book, we utilize a combination of TF-IDF and Sentence-BERT (sBERT) to find the most relevant documents for a given query. Following this, we employ the OpenAI API to use Generative AI to construct answers based on the selected documents. The overall goal is to create a robust system capable of providing detailed, accurate responses to questions about world history.
